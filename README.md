# colliderSummerSchool
This repo contains the instructions install Docker and pull Madgraph 5 and MadAnalysis 5. It also contains the slides presented in the ASDF Summer School for Collider Physics. The software presented is oriented to reproduce the Higgs boson discovery. This is achieved by simulating the reconstructed signal from the LHC detectors in MadGraph 5 using Pythia 8 and Delphes. Next, the quantities of interest, like reconstructed mass of the difoton comming from higgs decay, is analysed with MadAnalysis 5. We base the discovery on the bump showed in the "reconstructed mass" vs "number of evets" plot, showing signal of the higgs decay in the values bounded by previus experiments.
